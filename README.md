# Real Estate Property Listing Platform
This project is a *web-based real estate property listing platform* built using the *MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)* with *Tailwind CSS* for styling and *Vite* for fast React setup.

The platform allows users to *browse, search, and filter properties,* while admins can *add, update, and manage property listings.* It’s designed to be *responsive, interactive, and scalable,* providing a smooth user experience for property buyers, sellers, and agents.

**Features:-**

* *User Authentication:* Register, login, and manage accounts securely

* *Property Listings:* View detailed property information including images, price, location, and description

* *Search & Filters:* Filter properties by type, price range, location, and other criteria

* *Admin Dashboard:* Add, edit, or delete property listings

* *Responsive Design:* Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

* *Fast Performance:* Built with React + Vite for rapid load times and smooth interactions

**Technology Stack:-**

*1. Frontend:*

* React.js (with Vite for faster builds)

* Tailwind CSS for responsive styling

* React Router for navigation
